# Crowdfunding-ETL
Helping Brita from Independent Funding with ETL of current company data

8.3.4
restructure the data to create the campaign DataFrame.

8.3.5
The contacts_df DataFrame will contain the following columns, which all contain data from the contact_info worksheet:

A column named "contact_id" that contains the unique contact ID of each contact person.
A column named "first_name" that contains the first name of each contact person.
A column named "last_name" that contains the first name of each contact person.
A column named "email" that contains the email address of each contact person.

Youâ€™ll repurpose your code that uses the list comprehension to extract the "contact_id" number from each row and add the values to a new column, named "contact_id".

load the data into a database.
create a map of the database and table schemas.

8.5.3
create a new database in pgAdmin and create the tables by using the schema

8.5.4
load the data into a database. To do so, we'll use pgAdmin to import our saved CSV files.
